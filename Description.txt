Hello,

Here is the task. Do a small program in C# and provide us the source code / link to GitHub where we can view it.

 

Specs for the program:

-          A program that takes in a date and returns the names that match the given “name day”

-          C# console program that takes as an arg a date

-          The data should be read from the above CSV

-          Plus from the following

o   Exception handling

o   Configurability of file names

o   Unit-tests

 

I hope this approach works for you. Please reply back to this email with the solution.
